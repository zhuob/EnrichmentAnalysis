KEGG.db contains mappings based on older data because the original
  resource was removed from the the public domain before the most
  recent update was produced. This package should now be considered
  deprecated and future versions of Bioconductor may not have it
  available.  Users who want more current data are encouraged to look
  at the KEGGREST or reactome.db packages
