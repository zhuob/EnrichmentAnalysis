\title{Calculate sample (Pearson) correlations among gene clusters}
\usage{
btw_gene_corr(expression_data, trt, go_term, standardize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{expression_data}{the expressoin matrix.}

\item{trt}{treatment indicators, 1 for treatment, 0 for control group}

\item{go_term}{an indicator vector. 1 for genes in the test set, 0 otherwise}

\item{standardize}{whether the data should be standaridzed. It is
recommended to set \code{TRUE} for MEACA}
}
\value{
A 1 by 3 data frame containing values for \eqn{\rho_1},
  \eqn{\rho_3} and \eqn{\rho_2} respectively.
\item{testSetCor}{Average correlation for genes in the test set}
\item{interCor}{Average correlation between genes in the test set and those not in the test set}
\item{backSetCor}{Average correlations for genes not in the test set.}
